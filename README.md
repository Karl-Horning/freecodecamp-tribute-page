## 🤓 Overview

I originally built a tribute page as part of the **freeCodeCamp "Build a Tribute Page" challenge**, which I completed on **13 October 2017**.  

- Original (2017): [CodePen](https://codepen.io/karlhorning/pen/GqVaBw)  
- Updated (2018): this repo  

In 2018, I decided to revisit the challenge because the curriculum included **Bootstrap**. I wanted to practice using Bootstrap's grid and components, so I updated my tribute page to incorporate it. At the time, I didn't host the site anywhere because I wasn't confident with GitHub and didn't want to deal with image assets.  

This repo is that updated version, now published with **GitHub Pages** for the first time.

## ✍️ Code Style & Linting

- No linting or formatting tools were used in the original build.
- Commit messages now follow my personal Conventional Commits style (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `a11y`, etc.).
